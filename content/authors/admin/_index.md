I am a Data Science Lecturer at the [Data Science Campus](http://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk/), Office for National Statistics and an Affiliate Researcher at the University of Glasgow. I am a disease ecologist and marine biologist by training with a keen interest in programming, data science, and the use of novel data sources in research. Keep up with my data science explorations and science communication in [posts](#posts). You can find out more about my research in [projects](#projects) and my teaching in [courses](/courses).
