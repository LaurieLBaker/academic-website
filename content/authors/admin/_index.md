I am a Visiting Assistant Professor at [Bates College](https://www.bates.edu/) in Maine and an Affiliate Researcher at the University of Glasgow. I am a disease ecologist and marine biologist by training with a keen interest in programming, data science, and the use of novel data sources in research. You can keep up with my data science explorations and science communication in [posts](#posts). Find out more about my research in [projects](#projects) and my teaching in [courses](/courses).
