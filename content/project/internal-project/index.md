I used statistical methods
to analyse large spatial and long-term surveillance
datasets to improve our understanding of wildlife
rabies, a disease with major implications for public
health, wildlife conservation, and national economies.
Analyses were carried out predominantly in R using
JAGs and R-INLA software for fitting Bayesian models.
For this project, I developed a cutting-edge hierarchical Bayesian state-space model that incorporates process and
observation uncertainty to study fox rabies persistence
in response to the timing of vaccination campaigns
over the last 30 years in Germany. I then used this
model to explore the optimal timing of vaccination
campaigns and the impact of missed campaigns on
the time required to eliminate the disease through
simulation. During this work I collaborated with  ‪Håvard Rue ‬at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) and King
Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) and Elias Krainski from the Universidade Federal do Paraná (UFPR) in Brazil. During my MRC fellowship I developed a local spatiotemporal model of fox rabies dynamics fit to the GPS locations of rabies cases using a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) approach in the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) framework. By simultaneously modeling the spatial and temporal dynamics of disease spread, I was able to capture key aspects of rabies dynamics to inform ongoing vaccination campaigns in Eastern Europe and Russia.
