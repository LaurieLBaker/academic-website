I studied catch intention in the Chilean industrial longline fishery for my undergraduate dissertation for which I was awarded the Margaret Lang Award for best undergraduate dissertation in Marine Biology at the University of St. Andrews. In the same year I was awarded a small ecological project grant from the British Ecological Society to study the reproductive ecology of the female pink cusk-eel.

Like haggis, congrio dorado has a famous "Ode" written about it by Pablo Neruda [Oda al Caldillo de Congrio](https://www.neruda.uchile.cl/obra/obraodaselementales2.html).
