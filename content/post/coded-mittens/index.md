Colorwork knitting provides a wonderful creative template for learning to code and it isn't the first time that people saw the link between textiles and computers. The punchcards used in [Jacquard looms](https://www.nms.ac.uk/explore-our-collections/stories/science-and-technology/jacquard-loom/#:~:text=The%20punch%20cards%20used%20in,foundation%20for%20modern%20computer%20programming.&text=Did%20you%20know%3F,to%20programme%20his%20Analytical%20Engine.) inspired Charles Babbage in his early Analytical Machine and laid the foundation for modern computer programming.

For anyone who has followed a color-work knitting chart, you'll be familiar with the colored grid cells that guide you in what color to knit each stitch. Open an excel spreadsheet and you have a creative canvas to design your own knitting patterns.

Looking for creative ways to teaching programming concepts I naturally turned to knitting. You can explore a few of my tutorials and projects below:
