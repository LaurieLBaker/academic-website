Introducing [rspatialdata](https://rspatialdata.github.io/) a website that provides a collection of data sources and tutorials on downloading and visualising spatial data using R. The website includes a wide range of datasets including administrative boundaries of countries, Open Street Map data, population, temperature, vegetation, air pollution, and malaria data. The goal of the website is to equip researchers and communities with the tools to engage in spatial data analysis and visualisation so that they can address important local issues, such as estimating air pollution, quantifying disease burdens, and evaluating and monitoring the United Nationâ€™s sustainable development goals.

Explore the website and tutorials below or on the [rspatial website](https://rspatialdata.github.io/).
