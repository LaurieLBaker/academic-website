Humans have a complex relationship and checkered history with elephants. Once the revered subjects of myths and legends, elephants have increasingly become the objects of economic greed and the victims of habitat loss.

In this episode of Naturally Speaking Shorts, Laurie Baker (@llbaker1707) is joined by elephant researcher, Prof. Phyllis Lee, Director of Science for the Amboseli Elephant Research Project in Kenya and Professor of Psychology at the University of Stirling. Phyllis has spent the last 35+ years studying the social relationships and life history of elephants in Amboseli, and boy do those elephants have personality!
