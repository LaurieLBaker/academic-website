title: Conversations with an R Jedi
---

As much as we love it or hate it, programming plays an increasingly important part in biological research. In this episode of *Naturally Speaking Shorts*, Laurie Baker (@llbaker1707) speaks to Hadley Wickham, Chief Scientist at RStudio, about the ins and outs of programming. Hadley’s job, put simply, is writing software that helps people make sense of their data — making programming and data analysis in the statistical programme R less painful.
