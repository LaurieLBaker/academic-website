## Teaching Experience

I have experience teaching computer science and data science courses at the undergraduate and graduate level. As a data science lecturer and later head of faculty at the Office for National Statisticsâ€™ Data Science Campus, I designed and delivered graduate-level courses in data science in R and Python to over 147 analysts in the UK and internationally. This included leading a team in the design of a two-year graduate program teaching foundational methodologies in data science including: ethics and governance, designing effective workflows, statistics and visualization, reproducible code and best practice, machine learning, natural language processing, and databases and big data. In 2021 I became a certified [RStudio Tidyverse Instructor](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/people/baker+laurie/).

In 2021 I moved home to Maine, where I joined Bates College as a Visiting Assistant Professor in Digital and Computational Studies. I taught courses in Introduction to Programming and Computing in Python, [Programming for Data Analysis and Visualization in R](https://dcs210.netlify.app/), and [Community-Engaged Data Science](https://community-engaged-data-science.netlify.app/) as part of an interdisciplinary [Digital and Computational Studies](https://www.bates.edu/digital-computational-studies/values-goals-and-practices/) curriculum that centers critical digital studies and programming in context.

In 2022, I joined College of the Atlantic as a Professor of Computer Science. I am very excited to be teaching at a college where every student gets a degree in Human Ecology! I am excited to build up a curriculum that focuses on community-engaged data science and creative computing.
