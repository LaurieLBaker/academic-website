Yet, both surveillance and control measures are implemented within administrative units. Capturing local transmission processes and spatial coupling between regions from aggregate level data is therefore a technical challenge that can shed light on both theoretical questions and practical decisions. Fox rabies has been eliminated from much of Europe through oral rabies vaccination (ORV) programmes. The European Union (EU) co-finances ORV to maintain rabies freedom in EU member and border states via a cordon sanitaire. Models to capture local transmission dynamics and spatial coupling have immediate application to the planning of these ORV campaigns and to other parts of the world considering oral vaccination. We fitted a hierarchical Bayesian state-space model to data on three decades of fox rabies cases and ORV campaigns from Eastern Germany. Specifically, we find that (i) combining regional spatial coupling and heterogeneous local transmission allows us to capture regional rabies dynamics; (ii) incursions from other regions account for less than 1% of cases, but allow for re-emergence of disease; (iii) herd immunity achieved through bi-annual vaccination campaigns is short-lived due to population turnover. Together, these findings highlight the need for regular and sustained vaccination efforts and our modelling approach can be used to provide strategic guidance for ORV delivery. Moreover, we show that biological understanding can be gained from inference from partially observed data on wildlife disease.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Local rabies transmission and regional spatial coupling in European foxes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dr. Laurie Baker","Prof. Jason Mathiopoulos","Dr. Thomas Müller","Dr. Conrad Freuling","Prof. Katie Hampson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1583020800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583020800,"objectID":"61637fc5f026a41e9181557d7a1fdd74","permalink":"https://lauriebaker.rbind.io/publication/phil-trans-article/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/phil-trans-article/","section":"publication","summary":"Understanding how the spatial deployment of interventions affects elimination time horizons and potential for disease re-emergence has broad application to control programmes targeting human, animal and plant pathogens. We previously developed an epidemiological model that captures the main features of rabies spread and the impacts of vaccination based on detailed records of fox rabies in eastern Germany during the implementation of an oral rabies vaccination (ORV) programme. Here, we use simulations from this fitted model to determine the best vaccination strategy, in terms of spatial placement and timing of ORV efforts, for three epidemiological scenarios representative of current situations in Europe. We found that consecutive and comprehensive twice-yearly vaccinations across all regions rapidly controlled and eliminated rabies and that the autumn campaigns had the greater impact on increasing the probability of elimination. This appears to result from the need to maintain sufficient herd immunity in the face of large birth pulses, as autumn vaccinations reach susceptible juveniles and therefore a larger proportion of the population than spring vaccinations. Incomplete vaccination compromised time to elimination requiring the same or more vaccination effort to meet similar timelines. Our results have important practical implications that could inform policies for rabies containment and elimination in Europe and elsewhere.

Ecologists have developed methods for identifying the area(s) used by an animal (e.g., home range) and those used most intensely (utilization distribution) based on location data. However, few have extended these models beyond their traditional roles as descriptive 2D summaries of point data. Here we demonstrate how the home range method, T-LoCoH, can be expanded to quantify collective sampling coverage by multiple instrumented animals using grey seals (*Halichoerus grypus*) equipped with GPS tags and acoustic transceivers on the Scotian Shelf (Atlantic Canada) as a case study. At the individual level, we illustrate how time and space-use metrics quantifying individual sampling coverage may be used to determine the rate of acoustic transmissions received. Grey seals collectively sampled an area of 11,308 km2 and intensely sampled an area of 31 km2 from June-December. The largest area sampled was in July (2094.56 km2) and the smallest area sampled occurred in August (1259.80 km2), with changes in sampling coverage observed through time. T-LoCoH provides an effective means to quantify changes in collective sampling effort by multiple instrumented animals and to compare these changes across time. We also illustrate how time and space-use metrics of individual instrumented seal movement calculated using T-LoCoH can be used to account for differences in the amount of time a bioprobe (biological sampling platform) spends in an area.","tags":["Halichoerus grypus","Home range","Acoustics"],"title":"A novel approach to quantifying the spatiotemporal behavior of instrumented grey seals used to sample the environment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Baker LL","Jonsen ID","Mills Flemming JA","Lidgard DC","Bowen WD","Webber DE","Iverson SJ"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1417392000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1417392000,"objectID":"96344c08df50a1b693cc40432115cbe3","permalink":"https://lauriebaker.rbind.io/talk/example/","publishdate":"2014-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/example/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["Transceptores acústicos","Mamíferos marinos","Halichoerus grypus"],"title":"Los retos del uso de transceptores acústicos y de GPS adheridos a mamíferos marinos para detectar interacciones entre animales","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1412035200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1412035200,"objectID":"1533ff6e2e1bd59ba56644f9a2fc81f0","permalink":"https://lauriebaker.rbind.io/project/bioprobe-project/","publishdate":"2014-09-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/bioprobe-project/","section":"project","summary":"My masters work with the [Ocean Tracking Network](http://oceantrackingnetwork.org/) focused on grey seals (*Halichoerus grypus*) as bioprobes.","tags":["Scotian Shelf","Halichoerus grypus","Telemetry","GPS Tags","Acoustics"],"title":"Grey Seals on the Scotian Shelf","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Together with afrimapr I have been building an open access interactive learnr tutorial, afrijoin on spatial joins in R.

The development of dual transmitter/receivers, Vemco Mobile Transceivers (VMT), and satellite-linked (e.g. GPS) tags provides a unique opportunity to better understand between and within species interactions in space and time. Quantifying the uncertainty associated with detecting a tagged animal, particularly under varying field conditions, is vital for making accurate biological inferences when using VMTs. We evaluated the detection efficiency of VMTs deployed on grey seals, Halichoerus grypus, off Sable Island (NS, Canada) in relation to environmental characteristics and seal behaviour using generalized linear models (GLM) to explore both post-processed detection data and summarized raw VMT data. When considering only post-processed detection data, only about half of expected detections were recorded at best even when two VMT-tagged seals were estimated to be within 50–200 m of one another. At a separation of 400 m, only about 15% of expected detections were recorded. In contrast, when incomplete transmissions from the summarized raw data were also considered, the ratio of complete transmission to complete and incomplete transmissions was about 70% for distances ranging from 50–1000 m, with a minimum of around 40% at 600 m and a maximum of about 85% at 50 m. Distance between seals, wind stress, and depth were the most important predictors of detection efficiency. Access to the raw VMT data allowed us to focus on the physical and environmental factors that limit a transceiver’s ability to resolve a transmitter’s identity.","tags":["Detection efficiency","Acoustic Tag","Vemco Mobile Transceivers (VMT)"],"title":"Probability of Detecting Marine Predator-Prey and Species Interactions Using Novel Hybrid Acoustic Transmitter-Receiver Tags","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dr. Laurie Baker","Dr. Rodrigo Wiff","Dr. JC Quiroz","Andrés Flores","Renato Céspedes","Dr. Mauricio A.

Although the fishery was originally divided into a northern (41º28′–47º00′S) and southern (47º00′–57º00′S) zone for the purposes of fisheries management, recent studies have reported significant differences in life history parameters between these zones. Individuals from the southern zone reached larger asymptotic sizes and possessed higher survival rates compared to the northern zone. We estimate and compare the gonadosomatic index (GSI), shape of the maturity ogive, and length at 50 % maturity (L50%) of female *G. blacodes* between management zones and across time using biological data collected from the industrial fleet between 1985 and 2009. Females in the northern zone had higher monthly mean GSI than females in the southern zone. Our analyses also revealed L50% to be significantly higher in the southern zone than in the northern zone from 1985 to 2009. The significant differences in life-history traits between fishery management zones agree with the trade-offs predicted by Charnov’s life history theory. Together these results provide additional support for the hypothesis that two separate stocks exist and suggest that females from the northern zone have developed a life-history strategy, which favours early maturation and a proportionally greater investment in reproduction than females from the southern zone.","tags":[""],"title":"Reproductive ecology of the female pink cusk-eel (Genypterus blacodes) - Evaluating differences between fishery management zones in the Chilean austral zone","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Rabies is a deadly viral infection that kills over 50,000 people each year. Mass vaccination can greatly reduce the burden of vaccine-preventable diseases such as rabies, however, there is relatively little scientific guidance as to how long control programmes must operate and how they should be best implemented to achieve elimination. My PhD and Postdoc focused on two pivotal questions in infectious disease ecology:\n What are the underlying determinants of disease persistence? How can vaccination strategies be optimised to eliminate infection?  To answer these questions, I analysed a rich and highly resolved spatial dataset of fox rabies cases and oral rabies vaccination (ORV) programmes throughout Western Europe. The long-term, large-scale nature of these data provides a unique opportunity to improve our understanding of wildlife rabies dynamics in response to vaccination using novel spatial modeling techniques.\nI developed a cutting-edge hierarchical Bayesian state-space model that incorporates process and observation uncertainty to study fox rabies persistence in response to the timing of vaccination campaigns over the last 30 years in Germany\r(Baker et al. 2020). I then used this model to explore the optimal timing of vaccination campaigns and the impact of missed campaigns on the time required to eliminate the disease through simulation (Baker et al. 2019).\nDuring my PhD and Postdoc, I collaborated with Prof. ‪Håvard Rue ‬at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) and King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) and Dr. Elias Krainski from the Universidade Federal do Paraná (UFPR) in Brazil.\nDuring my MRC fellowship I developed a local spatiotemporal model of fox rabies dynamics fit to the GPS locations of rabies cases using a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) approach in the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) framework. By simultaneously modeling the spatial and temporal dynamics of disease spread, I was able to capture key aspects of rabies dynamics to inform ongoing vaccination campaigns in Eastern Europe and Russia.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2c9338fac358927da88ef5f8aada5770","permalink":"https://lauriebaker.rbind.io/project/rabies-project/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/rabies-project/","section":"project","summary":"Rabies is a deadly viral infection that kills over 50,000 people each year.
